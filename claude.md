## 📋 Overview

Suno AI uses the Chirp generative model to create songs. Success depends on using specific tags and formatting to prompt the model correctly. This guide provides comprehensive syntax and optimization techniques for professional results.

### Key Principles
- **Structure**: Use specific tags to define song sections
- **Modifiers**: Add adjectives for emotional/tempo control  
- **Effects**: Embed audio cues using proper formatting
- **Style**: Define genres and moods separately (1000 char limit)
- **Prompt**: Craft final description (950-1000 characters)

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Basic Song Structure
```
[Intro]
[Verse]
Your lyrics here
[Chorus] 
Your chorus lyrics
[Outro]
[End]
```

### With Modifiers
```
[Long Mellow Intro]
[Whispered Verse]
Your lyrics with emotions...
[Building Chorus]
Powerful lyrics! (ensemble vocals)
[Fading Outro]
[End]
```

## 🏷️ Base Tags Reference

### Primary Tags

| Tag | Purpose | Usage | Modifiers |
|-----|---------|-------|-----------|
| `[Intro]` | Song opening, instrumental | Beginning only | `Long Mellow`, `Short Exciting`, `Dreamy Slow` |
| `[Verse]` | Main story/narrative | Multiple uses | `Angry`, `Mysterious`, `Whispered`, `Spoken` |
| `[Chorus]` | Hook/refrain | Multiple uses | `Whispered`, `Eerie`, `Ensemble`, `Slow` |
| `[Bridge]` | Transition/contrast | Once per song | `Instrumental Bridge` (most effective) |
| `[Solo]` | Instrumental highlight | As needed | `[Soaring Lead Guitar Solo]`, `[Dancing Fiddle Solo]` |
| `[Outro]` | Song conclusion | Once at end | `Long Fading`, `Urgent Loud`, `Mournful` |
| `[End]` | Final termination | Last tag | `Fade to End`, `Lingering End` |

### Secondary Tags

| Tag | Purpose | Best Practices |
|-----|---------|----------------|
| `[Hook]` | Transition from intro | Rarely needed unless modified |
| `[Pre-Chorus]` | Story introduction | Use once, before chorus |
| `[Interlude]` | Instrumental break | `Melodic`, `Melancholy`, `Accelerating` |
| `[Break]` | Short instrumental pause | Specify instrument: `[Violin Break]` |
| `[Build]` | Tension builder | Use sparingly, between verse/chorus |
| `[Movement]` | Major transition | Experimental: `[Begin Psychedelic Movement]` |

## 🎯 Advanced Techniques

### Embedded Effects

#### For Vocal Songs
```
*atmospheric effects*          # Sound effects
(vocal effects)               # Vocal modifications  
! . ! . ! !                  # Rhythm patterns
```

#### For Instrumental Songs  
```
[FX: description]            # Audio effects
[technical instruction]      # Instrument techniques
! . . ! . .                 # Rhythm patterns only
```

### Rhythm Patterns
Use periods (.) and exclamations (!) to shape instrumental timing:

```
[Melodic Interlude]
. . . ! . .
. ! . . . !
```

```
[Intense Solo]
!! . ! !! !
!! !! ! !!
```

### Lyrical Techniques

| Technique | Effect | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `...` | Slower delivery | `Time passes... slowly... away...` |
| `!` | Emphasis | `Break free! Rise up!` |
| `(parenthesis)` | Call-and-response | `(Who are you?) I am the storm` |
| `Vocalizaaaations` | Extended sounds | `Ohhhhhh, ahhhhhh` |

## 🎨 Style Construction

### Format: `genre, subgenres, instruments, emotions, vocals` (1000 chars max)

### Effective Examples
```
space rock, stoner rock, psychedelic, soaring solos, shoegaze
Contemporary Classical, Neoclassical, Piano, Melancholic, Instrumental  
witchpop, folk, violin, acoustic, eerie, mysterious, clean vocals
Electronic, sweet female voice, dreamy, melodic, emotional
```

### Style Hierarchy
1. **Primary Genre** (most influence)
2. **Subgenres** (decreasing influence)  
3. **Key Instruments** (if not obvious)
4. **Emotions/Moods**
5. **Vocal Style** (if applicable)

## 📝 Examples

### Simple Structure
```
[Verse]
Sun beats down on dusty road  
Shadows dance in desert heat
[Chorus]
Lost in the wasteland void
Seeking the promised land
[Bridge]
Time moves slow, mind wanders far
[End]
```

### Complex Structure  
```
[intro]
. . . ! . .

[build]  
! . ! . ! !

[verse]
Engines burn through cosmic night
Breaking free from earthly chains

[break]

[chorus]
Beyond the distant stars
Where no soul has traveled  

[Soaring Guitar Solo]
! . . ! . .

[spoken word narration]
*static* Final transmission... 
Coordinates unknown...
*fade*

[fade to end]
```

### Instrumental Example
```
[Gentle Piano Intro]
[FX: soft sustain pedal, warm resonance]
. . . ! . .

[Cello Entry - Warm and Expressive]  
[FX: rich, woody tones]
[cello entrance with warm tone]

[Piano and Cello Duet]
[FX: interweaving melodies]
[building emotional depth]

[Peaceful Resolution]
[FX: gentle fade with natural reverb]
[End]
```

## 🖼️ Album Artwork

### Basic Format
```
album art: [subject], [scene], [style], [colors/mood], [optional text]
```

### Examples
```
album art: psychedelic desert scene, cactus and hot sun, vivid colors

album art: ethereal night sky, massive spiral galaxy, deep purple and blue cosmos, 
shimmering stars, minimalist "TITLE" text

album art: elegant piano in autumn room, warm golden light through windows, 
falling maple leaves, cozy atmosphere, no text
```

### Ultrarealistic 8K Examples  
```
8K ultrarealistic cinematic shot of elegant grand piano in cozy autumn living room, 
warm golden hour light streaming through large windows, beautiful wooden cello 
resting against piano bench, soft shadows on hardwood floors, no text, 
photorealistic lighting and textures, atmospheric

Ultra-realistic 8K macro shot of piano keys and cello strings in perfect harmony, 
warm amber lighting, shallow focus with dreamy bokeh, no text overlay, 
cinematic color grading, professional photography
```

## ✅ Best Practices

### Do's
- ✅ Use concrete, specific modifiers (`Melancholy` > `sad`)
- ✅ Specify instruments in solos (`Lead Guitar Solo`)  
- ✅ Keep styles under 1000 characters
- ✅ Use rhythm patterns for instrumentals
- ✅ Test different tag combinations
- ✅ Write prompts 950-1000 characters

### Don'ts  
- ❌ Overuse modifiers (less is more)
- ❌ Use genre-specific modifiers in tags (`Psychedelic Interlude`)
- ❌ Repeat similar sections excessively
- ❌ Mix formatting systems (*asterisks* with [brackets])
- ❌ Exceed character limits
- ❌ Use bridges more than once

### For Instrumental Music
- ✅ Always specify: "no vocals, no singing, only instruments"
- ✅ Use `[FX: description]` instead of `*effects*`
- ✅ Remove all vocalizations (mmm, ahh, etc.)
- ✅ Focus on instrument techniques

### For Vocal Music  
- ✅ Use `*effects*` for atmosphere
- ✅ Use `(effects)` for vocal modifications
- ✅ Include written vocalizations (Ohhhh, ahhhh)
- ✅ Specify vocal style in tags and prompt

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Unwanted vocals in instrumental | Add "purely instrumental, no vocals" to prompt |
| Effects not working | Check format: `*effects*` vs `[FX: effects]` vs `(effects)` |  
| Style ignored | Put primary genre FIRST, use concrete terms |
| Poor transitions | Use `[Build]`, `[Break]` strategically |
| Repetitive structure | Vary tag modifiers, add instrumental breaks |

### Format Cheat Sheet
- `*atmospheric effects*` → Vocal songs only
- `[FX: technical effects]` → Instrumental songs  
- `(vocal modifications)` → Vocal songs only
- `[technical instructions]` → Instrumental songs
- `! . . !` patterns → All instrumental sections

## 📊 Prompt Construction Template

### Final Prompt Structure (950-1000 characters)
```
[Language/Vocal specification] + [Primary genre] + [Instrumentation] + 
[Tempo/timing] + [Theme/narrative] + [Dynamic structure] + 
[Recording quality] + [Emotional arc] + [Special characteristics]
```

### Example  
```
Purely instrumental contemporary classical piano and cello duet, no vocals, only instruments. 
Melancholic neoclassical composition with delicate piano touch, warm cello with rich resonance, 
intimate chamber arrangement. Gentle tempo 65 BPM in major key with rubato phrasing. 
Themes of autumn reflection through serene storytelling. Dynamic structure from solo piano 
to passionate dialogue. Professional acoustic recording with natural ambience, pristine clarity. 
Emotional performance from peaceful intimacy to reflective expressions, featuring minimalist 
call-and-response and seamless melodic interweaving. Contemporary classical with New Age influences.
```
