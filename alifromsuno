[Chipmunk Vocal Sample – Hook]
And it's hot like hell and humid like heaven
Got the windows down
Radio station
Spitting out songs I don't wanna listen to
All I wanna hear is you


[loop begins... chipmunk vocal sample warped, low-pass filtered]
[pad: thick, humid analog wash, slight crackle]
[FX: car passing by and distant thunder]

And it's hot like hell and humid like heaven
Got the windows down
Radio station
Spitting out songs I don't wanna listen to
All I wanna hear is you

[loop dips, hold atmosphere, increase reverb tail]

[Verse 1 – Tight flow, minimal drums, industrial synths pulse like a slow heartbeat]
[beat: no drums yet – just pulsing sub synth, like a heartbeat underwater]
We were pushin’ 80 with the roof half broke,
Laughin’ at clouds like they inside jokes.
She lit a Parliament, sparked it with spite,
Said, “You always pick wrong, but you argue like you right.”

[drums enter: distorted 808, hi-hats staggered, synthetic clap every 2 bars]
Dash full of crumbs, past full of ghosts,
She said, “Pick a station that don’t lie the most.”
But the DJ played pain in a four-bar dose—
Every hook too clean, every verse too close.

[FX: reverse reverb swell on “close” → duck loop]
Fought at a diner on Exit 9,
She threw fries like fate, said “You never got time.”
I said, “Baby, I’m tryin’—” she said, “Try harder.”
Then kissed me like war, then smiled like water.

[choral pad enters]
Back in the ride, sweat dripped off her lip,
We made peace in silence, our fingers slipped.
And when the loop came on, she hummed that tune,
And the sun hit her cheek like a silver spoon.

[Hook – loop full volume, drums lift, euphoric synths]
[beat: soul loop + gospel chords + layered synths (Arp + Juno)]
[snare cracks like lightning, tempo steady]

And it's hot like hell and humid like heaven
Got the windows down
Radio station
Spitting out songs I don't wanna listen to
All I wanna hear is you

[Verse 2 – BEAT SWITCH: punchier, glitched synths enter, tempo up, flow swings harder]
[beat switch: glitched BULLY-style synth stabs, jagged 808s, wide stereo spread]
[loop now chopped into rhythmic vocal hits – syncopated with beat]
We hit the state line, gaslight flashin’
She said, “You trust fate?” I said, “I trust passion.”
Pulled to the shoulder, heartbeats clappin’
Kissed through a storm like nothin’ could happen.

[add background vocal loop: “mmm” / “yeah” (baby voice)]
Played truth or dare till we ran outta lies,
Her eyes said run, her hands said drive.
Said “Love ain’t safe,” I said “Neither are we,”
Then she laughed like fire, real low, off-key.

[synths swirl in reverse, field-recording of rain]
She sang to the static between two towns,
Danced in the lot when the rain came down.
I watched her twirl in a soaked white tee,
Like a scene too good for a memory.

[FX: tape stop on “memory” → sudden silence, then kick returns]
Next day, silence like a vinyl skip—
I said too much, then she dipped.
Left me with her ring and a stick-on note:
"Love is loud, but the echoes float."

[Hook – Loop re-enters, but now warped and stereo-panned]
[beat: gospel chords + analog synth shimmer + heavy sidechain]
[FX: stereo delay on vocal loop, chorus stacked]

And it's hot like hell and humid like heaven
Got the windows down
Radio station
Spitting out songs I don't wanna listen to
All I wanna hear is you

[Bridge – Pull all drums, use ambient pad + AI voice harmonizer on hook]
[beat: removed]
[pad: ambient shimmer, low rumble like thunder in the back seat]
[loop becomes distant, detuned]

Now I just ride to hear her name in static,
Search the dial like it’s cinematic.
They play what's hot, I play what's true—
Every song sounds wrong if it ain’t you.

[Final Hook – Loop layered, distorted, euphoric + falling apart]
[loop layered x2 – one pitched +2 semitones, one normal, both stereo-panned hard L/R]
[synths: soaring euphoria, gospel organ rising in background]
[drums: breakbeat stutter + clap rolls, mimicking emotional climax]

And it's hot like hell and humid like heaven
Got the windows down
Radio station
Spitting out songs I don't wanna listen to
All I wanna hear is you

[Outro: loop repeats 4x, slowly drowned in noise, then tape collapse]

[High-Pitch Vocal Sample – Loop x3]
I been tryin’ / to feel somethin’ / but every time / it don’t feel like nothin’
like nothin
like nothin!!!!

[High-Pitch Vocal Sample – Loop x3]
I been tryin’ / to feel somethin’ / but every time / it don’t feel like nothin’
like nothin
like nothin!!!!

[Verse 1]
counted twenty short, thought it was me (nah)
blamed the weed, blamed the week, blamed the fee
‘til i saw your thumbprint on the zelle receipt
ain’t no typo, that was trust you keyed
my mama said, "don’t loan what you can’t lose"
but that ain’t a loan when i fed you food
you was in the crib when my lights went blue
i ain’t blink — you blinked, and the mask came loose
whispers on a voice note, name in they mouth
sayin’ i switched up — boy, i built this house
irony cold when the heater’s out
you slept on my couch while you aired me out
now every laugh feel like a setup
text bubbles float like a threat dressed up
“u good?” — nah, but i won’t press up
you robbed me soft, with a hug and a bless-up

[High-Pitch Vocal Sample – Loop x3]
I been tryin’ / to feel somethin’ / but every time / it don’t feel like nothin’
like nothin
like nothin!!!!

[High-Pitch Vocal Sample – Loop x3]
I been tryin’ / to feel somethin’ / but every time / it don’t feel like nothin’
like nothin
like nothin!!!!

[Verse 2]
used to call my phone just to sit in the silence
now i ghost the groupchat, feed the violence
every “how you been?” sound like a wire
every dap a deal, every hug feel hired
couldn’t tell the real from the rhythm they speak in
couldn’t trust the love — even prayers felt sneakin’
i been movin' solo like a monk in grief
bought a couch too small for a second seat
ain’t no click, just tabs on the browser now
ain’t no crew, just echoes in the house now
i don’t do birthdays, i don’t do crowds
every “miss you” line just too damn loud
trust don’t bleed, it breaks — quiet
look around and the whole thing’s private
told myself, “you better get cold or die”
so i shrink when it’s warm, and i flinch at kind

[High-Pitch Vocal Sample – Loop x3]
I been tryin’ / to feel somethin’ / but every time / it don’t feel like nothin’
like nothin
like nothin!!!!

[High-Pitch Vocal Sample – Loop x3]

....

(“told me to run / told me to run…”)
(“told me to run / told me to run…”)
(“told me to run / told me to run…”)
(“told me to run / told me to run…”)

...

[Verse 1 ]
Used to fake sleep when the door creaked wide
Mama peek in, say “He fine.”
Whole room cold, but I ain’t mind—
Learned early how to freeze my spine.

Church shoes tight, had to smile through pinches
Suit too big, but I passed the pictures
Hands in lap, “don’t twitch, don’t twitch”
I blinked too loud, got hit for flinchin’

Tried football—cracked my ribs
Coach said, “Shake it off, that’s it.”
Felt pain bloom like a Sunday hymn
But I just grinned and limped back in

[Hook – Sample Only, 3x Loop]
(“Told me to run / told me to run…”)
(“Told me to run / told me to run…”)
(“Told me to run / told me to run…”)

[Verse 2]
Therapist said “You name it, we tame it.”
I said “I’m fine” — then changed the subject
Talked ‘bout shows, talked ‘bout fame
Talked ‘bout her, but not what it touched yet

Date nights feel like job interviews
Smile rehearsed, got fallback cues
"Yeah that’s crazy!" / "Same here too!"
Told a girl *“I’m honest”— that was not true

Scroll too much just to feel engaged
Friends on mute, but I act amazed
Can’t cry sober, can’t sleep late
And all my wins just evaporate

[Hook – Sample Only, 3x Loop]
(“Told me to run / told me to run…”)
(“Told me to run / told me to run…”)
(“Told me to run / told me to run…”)

[Verse 3]
Woke up to birds that ain’t sound like songs
Just alarms with feathers on
Mirror said, “Try again.” I did.
Still felt like a guest inside my skin.

Bought new shoes. Didn’t wear ‘em.
Wrote new goals. Didn’t care ‘em.
Read a book ‘bout Zen, turned anxious
Prayed one night, felt nothin’ but language

Watched my hands move. That’s all I trust.
Heard my name in love, didn’t feel like us.
Had a dream where my dad said “son,”
Woke up sweating. Mouth full of blood.

[Hook – Sample Only, Final 3x Loop, slower each time]
(“Told me to run / told me to run…”)
(“Told me to run / told me to run…”)
(“Told me to run / told me to run…”)

[Outro – spoken]

-----------------------

[High Pitch Vocal Sample]
"Oh, love... is it love?" 
"Oh, love... is it love?" 
"Oh, love... is it love?" 


...
[Verse 1]
Used to fall asleep to her voice notes,
Now I play 'em like a voicemail roulette
"Hey it’s me" (click)—next one
"Where you at?"—I ain’t answer yet

Told her once, “I’m sorry for real,”
Told her twice, forgot what was real
Third time? She said, “That’s cute.”
Then changed her number to something I feel

Still think ‘bout that Lyft ride—
Arguin’ hard in the back like it’s mine
Driver played gospel, tried to ignore us
She cried, I joked—I do that sometimes

I said, “You ain’t here.”
She said, “That’s the point.”
I smiled like it meant less—
She right though that's the point

[Hook]

[BEAT SWITCH]

[Verse 2]
Text unsent with a period hangin’
Screenshot thread with a date still bangin’
Her mama called me “baby,” now she ghost me
Blocked me once, then unblocked—coasting

Spoke too slick like I’m built for riddles
She said, “You love crowds, not me in the middle.”
I was in Nobu, she was in flats
Told me “Call me later,” I ain’t call back

Now it’s been—
Three missed birthdays, five missed flights
Seven typed drafts, one long night
Tried new love—got close, then dipped
Whole new girl lookin’ just like grief

Told my friends, “I'm chillin’, I'm fine.”
Told the mic, “I'm dyin' in time.”
Told her, “Pull up.” She said, “For what?”
Click. Cold air. I ain’t moved from the spot.

[Hook]
(“Oh, love… is it love?”)
(“Oh, love… is it love?”)
(“Oh, love… is it love?”)

[Bridge]
She wanted stillness, I brought storms.
She wanted mornings, I brought forms.
She said, “Be real,” I brought poems.
She said, “No more,” and I heard horns.

[Hook]
(“Oh, love… is it love?”)
(“Oh, love… is it love?”)
(“Oh, love… is it love?”)

[Outro – humming, soul]

[Intro]
“i thought i could be / I thought i could be / FREEEEEEEE”


[Verse 1]
I thought the floor was lava, but the ceiling caught my flame (“i thought i could be”)
I thought the world was plastic, then it melted into shame (“i thought i could be”)
I thought the sky had hands—I reached, it never came (“i thought i could be”)

I thought my voice was velvet, but it frayed against the glass (“i thought i could be”)
I thought a whisper meant control—but quiet never lasts (“i thought i could be”)
I thought I made a masterpiece—just dirt inside a mask (“i thought i could be”)

I thought I had a future, built from silence and belief (“i thought i could be”)
I thought my name was lightning—but I broke without a streak (“i thought i could be”)
I thought I could be free

[Hook – Sample Forward, No Words Over It]
“i thought i could be / I thought i could be / FREEEEEEEE”
[Sample loops raw, minimal beat underneath. Nothing else. Let it breathe.]

[Verse 2]
I thought the beat could lift me—but the floor was made of drums (“i thought i could be”)
I thought I’d speak in color—then my tongue just tasted numb (“i thought i could be”)
I thought I’d be the ending, not the child who’d come undone (“i thought i could be”)

I thought the mirror held me—just a window with a frame (“i thought i could be”)
I thought I’d outrun gravity—but weight became my name (“i thought i could be”)
I thought my pain was fiction—but it rhymed in every flame (“i thought i could be”)

I thought I’d be a singer—but my pitch was made of dirt (“i thought i could be”)
I thought I’d break the silence—but the silence sang me first (“i thought i could be”)
I thought I could be free

[Hook – Sample Louder Now, Layered with Reverb]
“i thought i could be / I thought i could be / FREEEEEEEE”
[FREEEEEEEE stretches longer, trailing off like breath held too long]

[Verse 3 – The Climax. Hardest Images. Deepest Cuts.]
I thought my scars were symbols—but they blurred into the skin (“i thought i could be”)
I thought my rage was righteous—then it burned me from within (“i thought i could be”)
I thought I’d bloom in summer—but I froze beneath the grin (“i thought i could be”)

I thought my words were gospel—till they cracked inside the choir (“i thought i could be”)
I thought my hope was endless—then it curled up like a wire (“i thought i could be”)
I thought I’d write the future—but I inked out my desire (“i thought i could be”)

I thought I’d die forgotten—but the loop still knows my name (“i thought i could be”)
I thought I’d vanish softly—but I haunt the beat with flame (“i thought i could be”)
I thought I could be free

[Final Hook – Sample Only. Let It Echo.]
“i thought i could be / I thought i could be / FREEEEEEEE”
[Repeat once. Then silence.]



....

[Euphoric beat switch - New Beat, Synth Heavy, Anthem, Unexpected]

[Verse 3 – The Climax. Hardest Images. Deepest Cuts.]
I thought my scars were symbols—but they blurred into the skin (“i thought i could be”)
I thought my rage was righteous—then it burned me from within (“i thought i could be”)
I thought I’d bloom in summer—but I froze beneath the grin (“i thought i could be”)

I thought my words were gospel—till they cracked inside the choir (“i thought i could be”)
I thought my hope was endless—then it curled up like a wire (“i thought i could be”)
I thought I’d write the future—but I inked out my desire (“i thought i could be”)

[Intro - High Pitch Vocal Sample]

too loud to think
too loud to think
too loud to think
too loud to think

[Verse 1]

I ain’t slept in days,
but I lied like I did.
Said I’m fine in a text,
then I cried like a kid.

Too tense to pray,
too numb to blink.
Still I try to escape—
but it’s too loud to think.

My thoughts talk fast
and they shout in pairs.
When I say “I’m okay,”
it just sounds like fear.

Told mom I was good,
she said “baby, you shrink
every time you say that.”
(too loud to think)

My chest don’t breathe
like it used to breathe.
Now it heaves like a tide
under rusted beams.

And I laugh too hard
when I start to sink.
So it looks like joy—
but it’s too loud to think.

I got playlists that feel
like a panic attack.
I got verses that peel
every wound I patch.

Told my friends “I’m chill,”
but I’m right on the brink.
You can smile on the surface
when it’s too loud to think.

[Hook – Sample-led, emotionally loaded, mantra-style]
[loop: “too loud to think” (high-pitched, layered w/ octave below), centered in mix]
[drums: full beat – booming 808 + gospel clap stack + hi-hat triplet rolls]
[synth: euphoric lead melody layered with detuned organ]
[bass: sliding sub matching loop phrasing]
[fx: whispered ad-libs under loop, “breathe,” “wait,” “don’t”]

too loud to think
too loud to think
too loud to think
too loud to think

[Beat + Tempo Switch – Verse 2 begins]
[tempo: increases +12 bpm]
[drums: glitched bounce pattern with trap fills + off-grid hat layering]
[sample: chopped “too loud to think” echoes behind bars instead of ending them]
[synth: sharp synth stabs replace bell, bass gets more melodic movement]

[Verse 2 – Long-form lines, breathless rhythm, unraveling emotion]
[drums: kick doubles in second half of each bar, snares detuned slightly for tension]
[synth: rising chord progression beneath vocals, quiet synth screams layer in at bar 5]

I been hidin’ in the noise, tryna find a quiet pocket,
but every time I get still, my thoughts pickpocket the silence.
They run through me like wolves through fog,
pullin’ at threads I ain't knotted in years—
and I just nod like I’m not in tears.

I be smilin’ while I panic.
I be jokin’ when it’s manic.
My joy come with disclaimers now,
like: “Don’t mind me, I’m damaged.”

I got habits that wear me like jackets—
and zip up my throat when I try to speak.
I stay dressed in "I’m okay,"
but the seams don’t stretch,
and the breath still leaks.

When the night gets loud, I hum.
When the light comes in, I run.
Tell the world “I’m blessed,”
while I wrestle my chest
just tryna inhale one.

And the walls close in
like a hug too tight,
like love from someone
who don’t get it right.
And I still say “thanks,”
'cause I can’t un-feel,
and I still break down
when the beat too real.

(too loud to think)

[Final Hook – Maximal emotional intensity, full sonic height]
[loop: “too loud to think” x4, harmonized + chopped echo layer underneath]
[drums: full breakbeat stack + clap roll fills + deep low-end rumble]
[synth: euphoric gospel lead layered w/ rising synth arp + organ chords]
[bass: gliding, melodic, layered with modulating sub]
[fx: crowd swell + thunder crack + whispered “hold it…” layered behind final pass]

too loud to think
too loud to think
too loud to think
too loud to think

[Outro – Sample disintegrates, slow collapse]
[drums: remove kick, just filtered snare + fading hats]
[sample: “too loud to think” loop slows + distorts, fading into silence]
[synth: hold final organ chord, reverb tail extended]
[fx: final exhale sample, vinyl hiss fade-out]

too loud to think
(barely audible, whispered once)

---------------------------------

[Intro – Soul Loop, No Beat Yet]
(sample: “—i was good to you—”) 
(whispers: “i know.”)

[Verse 1 – Soft, Controlled]
I watched your voice age in the voicemails
Played ‘em like records / regret got details
I raised my voice / you lowered your head
Now I replay that frame till the colors are dead

(sample: “—i was good to you—”) [continues under each bar]

You ain't ask for the world / just for me to show up
I ghosted your joy just to grow up
Tried to stretch time with a sorry
But you can't unbruise a story

[Hook – Sung, Subdued, Under the Loop]
You loved in HD
I saw you in low-res
I only get it now that the screen froze
(You were good to me)
I was cold to you
Now I hold to you
In every loop

(sample: “—i was good to you—”) [loop layers, stereo bounce]

[Beat Switch – Euphoric synth]


[Verse 2 – Distorted Flow, Pain Pushed Out]
I called it love / but I weaponized peace
I called it growth / but I blamed your grief
Now I’m dressed in the silence you left
Each morning I mourn what I never kept

I texted you last week — unsent
I framed the “what if” in 8K lament
I said “I changed” — too late to show
Love left receipts I can't outgrow

(sample: “—i was… good… to… you—”) [now fragmented and stuttering]

[Bridge – Spoken, Beat Drops Out]
You ain't slam the door
You just stopped waiting
And the quiet felt louder
Than all the things I said in anger

[Hook – Reprise – Minimal, Just Piano + Loop]
(You were good to me)
Now I’m learning too late
That apologies can’t translate
The weight of “wait”

(sample: “—i was good to you—”) [final loop echoes to silence]

[Outro – Faint Static, Loop Degrades]
[loop continues once more, pitched up and degraded]
(whispers: “i know.”)
