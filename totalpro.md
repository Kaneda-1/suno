I don't know what's real or fabricated 
Since your little white lies got out of hand
Can't believe your words and I hate it
Got me wondering if it was all planned

***Chorus***
I'm wondering if i'm overthinking
But my brain is stuck in overdrive 
Im wondering if I'm overthinking 
what if this time we don't survive

I didnt sign up to be a detective
But now im analyzing every gosh darn move
Can you even try to see my perspective? 
I'm on high alert like I got a case to prove

Cause your just a Liar liar! 
Wish I could throw your stuff out and light it on fire
Cause your just a liar liar!
That's the over thinking making my brain go haywire

I go crazy when I dont know the truth
So please dont make me question you
Or we won't connect - just like a bad bluetooth
There no reasoning your point of view

Cause you can give me a hundred thousand reasons
Why you felt the need to lie to the love of your life 
But i can see through all your dark demons 
How about you tell me one reason to still be your wife

I'm wondering if i'm overthinking
But my brain is stuck in overdrive 
Im wondering if I'm overthinking 
what if this time we don't survive

[Modulate key:D]  

—just like before  
But darling, I ain’t keepin’ score  
That time you swore you’d quit the dice  
Yet lost our rent—**twice**  

[Modulate key:A]  
You claimed my laugh was sweet relief  
Funny how you **lied through your teeth**  
But sugar, here’s the final call—  
I ain’t yours at all

My–hand– shaking
My– Breath ‐ you- have -taken
I-see - with more than just eyes
Thru- all- of your- terrible lies

[Bridge]

Oh, I could list your wild mistakes  
The **cowboy swagger**, the **fishy stakes**  
But truth be told, why waste my time  
On a fool past his prime  

[Outro]  
[Modulate key:G]  
So tip your hat and walk away  
A woman’s strength don’t fade or sway  
This heart won’t **beg**, this pride won’t bend  
No need to start—**this is the end**
[Pedal steal guitar Solo]

[ Outro CHORUS]
My–hand– shaking
My– Breath ‐ you- have -taken
I-see - with more than just eyes
Thru- all- of your- terrible lies
